## {{site.data.course.name}}

This is the workshop website for **{{site.data.course.number}}**:
{{site.data.course.name}}.

### Introduction

Did you ever:

- want to use your text both for papers and websites or blogs;
- feel constrained by Microsoft's `Word` (but hesitate to adopt `LaTeX`);
- want to go back to a previous version of the text but accidentally deleted it or argue with co-authors which document version was the latest;
- think that it would be nice (and very efficient) if you could easily share and access background material of papers?

But did not know how to start with this, then this workshop might be of interest to you.

### Aim of the workshop
To get regional scientists familiar with `Markdown`, the versioning system `Git` and using open repositories, in particular `GitHub`.

From a wider perspective, these type of tools serve brilliantly to make your research as reproducable as possible, because (*i*) `Markdown` can be read by anyone because it is just plain text, (*ii*) `Git` allows you to go back in time for your research so that you can always trace back what the **past you** have done and (*iii*) `Github` provides easy access for others to see what both **you** and the **past you** have done.

### What?
It focuses on using a very simple markup language (`Markdown`) and its interaction with one of the major open repositories `GitHub`. Typically, `Markdown` is used for blogging but can as well be used for writing papers, as the `Markdown` syntax can very easily be transformed in `HTML` or `LaTeX` files (or to the open office format if needed). To do so, we use the `RStudio` application, which is probably one of the applications easiest to use *out of the box* and where the conversion between formats is done automatically *under the hood*. Note that this workshop does not deal with using `R` or literate programming (weaving text and code with, e.g., `R`'s `Knitr` package).

Moreover, we will deal with the versioning system `Git` in combination with the `GitHub` open repository platform. We do not aim to give all details of `Git` or using `Git` from the command line, instead we will use a desktop application with a graphical user interface with serves best as a first gentle introduction of both `Git` and `Github`.

### Contents?
This workshop includes a hands-on overview of specific tools that have been designed with open science and reproducibility principles in mind. This is delivered alternating presentation time with demo time, allowing participants to get a real taste of what using the tools implies and see live their advantages.

In more detail, the workshop is structured as follows:

1. Introduction to reproducibility and open science workflow principles (20 mins.)
2. `Markdown` language (45 mins.)
3. Principles behind `Git` and workflow examples (60 mins.)
4. Publication of your material on the open repository `GitHub` (45. mins).

### Target group
Scientists in the social sciences (e.g., economics, geography, planning)

### Previous knowledge
No previous knowledge required


### Introduction

Contrary to what many people believe, there are very good alternatives to *Word* (and *PowerPoint*). In the scientific world, though significantly less in the social sciences, the typesetting program *LaTeX* is often used. In many ways, including style, consistency, performance, and--most importantly--reproducability, *LaTeX* is far more superior than *Word*. The downside is that *LaTeX* has a far more steeper learning curve than *Word*. We therefore give two introductionary workshops for those students who are sincerely interested in using *LaTeX* (and some associated applications) and are willing to give it a try. 

Moreover, being able to work with *LaTeX* enables you to better understand why so many scientific applications nowadays center around using plain `.txt` files, such as *GitHub*, *R*, *Stata* do files, *SPSS* sytax files, scriptfiles for *ArcGis*, *HTML*, blogs and data you can readily derive from websites such as *Twitter* and *Google*. 

Be warned however, deciding to use new tools are usually costly in terms of **time**. However, in the end it is hopefully very rewarding, if not for only getting these pesky references right. Moreover, understanding *LaTeX* syntax might as well be helpful because most formulas nowadays used on internet (especially on Wikipedia) are created by *LaTeX* commands.

### Details

#### For whom?

Students who are interested in using *LaTeX* for larger projects such as theses in combination with reference managers (in this case we use *Mendeley*.

#### Tuition form

Two workshop of two hours each, where each workshop is characterized by in-class hands-on exercises.

#### Preparation

Each student willing to participate is **highly** encouraged to bring his or her own laptop and to install the required packages indicated on the [download](./download) page. All materials to be used and downloaded are open source software (or at least free to use).
