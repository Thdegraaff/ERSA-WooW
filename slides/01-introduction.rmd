# Introduction

## *Why* this workshop?

- In the *social sciences* few attention to what tools to use (and why they make sense)

- Increasing *need* for/in openness & transparancy

    - from journals, universities and governments
    - increase in cooperation (over wider distances)
    - access to your own files
    - make yourself more visible 

## What I want (and don't want) with this workshop 

- Interested in the principles behind a good open (scientific) workflow, aware of the facts that

    - there is no final, optimal, set of workflow tools
    - investment is very, very costly

- However, being a practical workshop we do

    - work with a specific set of tools (markdown, R, RStudio, git) which
    - enables us *in this workshop* to  make a paper reproducable and open
    
## How we do it

- Every session start with some introductionary slides 

- Then some assignment is given
    - use with some tool
    - try to figure it out for yourself

## Related work 

- Inspired by Kieran Healey's (associate professor in sociology) work: [Choosing your Workflow Applications](http://kieranhealy.org/files/misc/workflow-apps.pdf)

- Courses for reproducable research seems to pop up everywhere (but mostly in datascience courses):
    - Datascience course: [https://www.coursera.org/](https://www.coursera.org/)
    - Tools for Reproducible Research [http://kbroman.org/Tools4RR/](http://kbroman.org/Tools4RR/)

# Workflow 

## Open?

* Workflow: 
  *Progression of steps (tasks, events, interactions) that comprise a work process, involve two or more persons, and create or add value to the organization's activities* ([BusinessDictionary](http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/workflow.html))

* Open workflow: One that enhances *transparency*, *collaboration* and *reproducibility*

## Research cycle

![Research cycle](fig/ResearchCycle.png)

## Why bother about a workflow or tools?

- Good scientific practice: *document how you have achieved your results*; this ensures

    - Reproducibility 
    - Transparency
    - Modularity
    - Portability (across systems and users)
    - Efficiency
    - Self-sanity

## Why should it be open?

* Open Science
* Reproducibility
* Transparency
* Modularity
* Portability (across systems and users)
* Efficiency
* Visibility

## When should I adopt an open reproducable workflow?

* The sooner the better
* But think twice about which one (switching is costly)
* Start one step at a time 

*A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step* 

Lao-tzu

# Reproducability

## In general

> In science consensus is irrelevant. What is relevant is reproducible results. The greatest scientists in history are great precisely because they broke with the consensus (Michael Crichton)


## In computation science:

> The data and code used to make a finding are available and they are sufficient for an independent researcher to recreate the finding (Peng, 2011)

- Literature programming (Donald E. Knuth, 1984):

    - weaving of **code**, **documentation** and **output** (articles, presentations, websites) 

## In the social sciences?

- Complete reproducability often not feasible
    - qualitative research
    - proprietary data (?)
- but you can come a long way, especially with
    - theoretical work
    - quantitative (e.g., statistical or simulation) work

- Goal should be more to make your research as reproducable *as possible*

## Code, documentation and output

1. Synonyms

2. All based on text files

3. Encompasses almost anything
    - data itself
    - set of commands for data cleaning and statistical analysis
    - database with references 
    - transcript of interviews
    - text for aticles, presentations or websites
    
4. Only output is displayed/interpreted differently (e.g., in a browser or pdf viewer)


## Tools for reproducability

- Markup lanaguages
    - Markdown

- Versioning system (Git)

- Online repository (GitHub)

- Terminal tools (diff, pandoc)
    RStudio
    GitHub DeskTop
    
Only implicitly we make use of LaTeXHTML and pandoc (all under the hood of RStudio)
